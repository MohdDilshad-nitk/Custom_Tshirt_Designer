# Customizable T-Shirt Website

This project is a website that allows users to customize the color and logo of a 3D T-shirt model. The website is built using Three.js, React,Node,Express and the OpenAI API.

## Features

- Users can upload their own images to customize the logo on the T-shirt.
- Users can select different colors for the T-shirt using a color picker.
- Users can utilize the OpenAI API to generate custom images for the T-shirt logo and even full Tshirt Texture.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Three.js: A 3D graphics library that allows us to render the T-shirt model.
- OpenAI API: Used to generate custom images for the T-shirt logo.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/MohdDilshad-nitk/Custom_Tshirt_Designer`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your-repo`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Set up your OpenAI API key by following the instructions provided by OpenAI.
5. Start the development server: `npm start`

## Configuration

To configure the OpenAI API key, you'll need to create a `.env` file in the root of your project directory and add the following line:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

Replace `your-api-key` with your actual OpenAI API key.

## Usage

Once the development server is running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` or the link provided by the vite in the terminal to access the website. From there, users can interact with the 3D T-shirt model, customize the color, and upload or generate images for the logo.
